# FlexBOX
Flexbox mastery in PROGRESS.

Flexbox is a CSS layout model that helps distribute space and align items in a container efficiently, even when their size is unknown or dynamic.
To use it, set `display: flex` on a container and the child elements become flex items.

The `justify-content` property controls horizontal alignment (start, center, space-between, etc.).
The `align-items` property controls vertical alignment on the cross axis.

`flex-wrap` allows items to move to the next line when they overflow the container.
`flex-direction` changes the direction (row, column, and their reverse versions).

Each flex item can grow or shrink using `flex-grow`, `flex-shrink`, and `flex-basis`.
You can also use the shorthand `flex` to define how items behave in a single line.

Flexbox is one-dimensional — it handles either rows or columns, not both at once.
It’s best used when you need flexible layouts without the complexity of grid system.
